             <p>As of 2023 we do not have any Position Maximums, if brought up as a possible change, it would take a league vote of 7 managers or more agreeing to add them.

League Leaders reserve the right to review any and all trades.</p> 
    <p>If one or more of the League Leaders is involved in the trade and a review is called for by either league vote or the remaining League Leader, the league representative and or their alternate (as of 2023 Wesley Anderson is the league representative, and Kevin Wilson the alternate) will take the place of the League Leaders involved with the trade that is in review.</p>  
    <p>In the event that a trade needs to be pushed through faster than the alloted review time, the League Leaders (or if needed League Representatives) will determine the validity of the trade and rule to process or veto the trade.</p>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First Offense – Immediate reduction of FAAB budget by 50% for a total of 18 in season weeks, as well as a 50% FAAB budget penality for the end of season FA signing period In the event the participants are out of FAAB at the time of being found guilty, the penality will take in to effect at the start of the next season.</li>
            <li>Second Offense – Immediate freeze on all transactions, with a league vote on if the manager should be expelled from the league. If the vote allows for the manager to stay in league, the manager will face the penality of having transactions frozen for the next 4 in season weeks AND a loss of their next available 1st round draft pick.</li>
            <li>Third Offense – *Immediate expulsion.</li>
            <li>In the event a Manager leaves the league, any penality they are facing WILL NOT carry over to the new manager.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>*Collusion includes the organizing of veto votes against an acceptable trade.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
